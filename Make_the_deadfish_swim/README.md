DESCRIPTION:
Write a simple parser that will parse and run Deadfish.

Deadfish has 4 commands, each 1 character long:

i increments the value (initially 0)
d decrements the value
s squares the value
o outputs the value into the return array
Invalid characters should be ignored.

parse("iiisdoso") => [ 8, 64 ]
